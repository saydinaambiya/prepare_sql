Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths. 
SQL :
SELECT CASE WHEN A + B <= C OR A + C <=B OR B + C <= A THEN 'Not A Triangle'
WHEN A = B AND B = C THEN 'Equilateral'
WHEN A = B OR B = C OR A = C THEN 'Isosceles'
ELSE 'Scalene'
END FROM TRIANGLES ;
